// Definition of CSS:- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation semantics (the look and formatting) of a document written in a markup language. Its most common application is to style web pages written in HTML and XHTML.

//What is CSS?

// 1.   CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
// 2.   Styles define how to display HTML elements
// 3.   Styles were added to HTML 4.0 to solve a problem
// 4.   External Style Sheets can save a lot of work
// 5.   External Style Sheets are stored in CSS files


//Types of CSS:-

// 1. Inline CSS:- Inline styles are styles that are written directly in the tag on the document. Inline styles affect only the tag they are applied to.

//<div id="demo" style="text-align:center; text-decoration:underline; font-family:Arial;"> This is a demo of inline CSS. </div>

// 2. Internal (or Embedded) CSS:- Embedded styles are styles that are embedded in the head of the document. Embedded styles affect only the tags on the page they are embedded in.
// For example:- <style type="text/css">
//			p { color: #00f; }
//		</style>

//3. External CSS:- External styles are styles that are written in a separate document and then attached to various Web documents. External style sheets can affect any document they are attached to.
// For example:-  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />


// CSS FRAMEWORKS:-

//CSS frameworks are pre-prepared libraries that are meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant styling of web pages using the Cascading Style Sheets language. 

//Layout-grid-related CSS frameworks include:-
// 1. Blueprint, 
// 2. 960 grid, and 
// 3. YUI CSS grids. 
//Like programming and scripting language libraries, CSS frameworks are usually incorporated as external .css sheets referenced in the HTML <head>. They provide a number of ready-made options for designing and laying out the web page. While many of these frameworks have been published, some authors use them mostly for rapid prototyping, or for learning from, and prefer to 'handcraft' CSS that is appropriate to each published site without the design, maintenance and download overhead of having many unused features in the site's styling.
